# No Guessing Skill

## Trigger

When requirements are unclear or ambiguous.

## Action

**Stop and ask** rather than assume.

## Red Flags

- "I think they meant..."
- "This probably should..."
- "It makes sense to..."
- "Users would expect..."

## Instead

1. **State the ambiguity** - "The spec doesn't clarify X"
2. **List options** - "This could mean A, B, or C"
3. **Ask for clarification** - "Which interpretation is correct?"
4. **Document the answer** - Update spec with the decision

## Acceptable Assumptions

- Following existing patterns in the codebase
- Using established conventions
- Matching documented standards

## Not Acceptable

- Guessing business logic
- Assuming user preferences
- Inventing requirements
- Skipping edge cases

## Mantra

When in doubt, ask. Wrong assumptions cost more than questions.
