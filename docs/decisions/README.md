## ADR Status Definitions

- **Accepted** - Decision approved and in effect
- **Deprecated** - No longer recommended but may still be in use
- **Superseded** - Replaced by a new decision (link provided)

## Creating New ADRs

1. Copy the template structure from an existing ADR
2. Use sequential numbering: ADR-002, ADR-003, etc.
3. Update this index when adding new ADRs
4. Include all sections: Context, Decision, Options, Rationale, Consequences
